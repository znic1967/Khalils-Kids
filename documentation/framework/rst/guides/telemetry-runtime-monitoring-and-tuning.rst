Telemetry: Embedded Runtime Monitoring and Tuning
===================================================

Wikipedia:

	**Telemetry** is an automated communications process by which measurements and other data are collected at remote or inaccessible points and transmitted to receiving equipment for monitoring.

Telemetry is another means of testing your firmware. Unit test are useful for testing your code's logic and making sure the behavior of your code operates as intended. A debugger allows you step through your code one line at a time, inspecting variables to see when adverse behavior arises in your firmware. Telemetry, more or less, is a means of feeding back information to the user about the current state of the firmware during runtime.
