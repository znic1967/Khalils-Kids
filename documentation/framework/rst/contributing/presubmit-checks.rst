SJSU-Dev2 Presubmit Checks
=============================
Before you can merge anything to SJSU-Dev2 repo, you need to preform a few
presubmit checks.

The presubmit checks will build, test, and lint the code, as well as check to
make sure that the current commit stage is clean. The following sections will go
into detail about these processes and wha thtey do.

Building & Testing
-------------------
The purpose of this action for presubmit is to verify that any changes made to
the repository doesn't break the project's ability to build and test software.
Even small changes can break the whole system.

Linting
--------
Linting code is the process of running a program, in this case we use Google's
:code:`cpplint.py` script, to evaluate each source file to make sure that they
conform to our coding style standards as well as do some rudamentory checks for
code pratices that may be dangerous or produce bugs.

Cpplint follows the `Google C++ style guide`_. The google cpplint repository can
be found here_.

.. _Google C++ style guide: https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html
.. _here: https://github.com/google/styleguide

To lint the source code of your project as well as the SJSU-Dev2 libraries,
in your project directory, run :code:`make lint`. If there are any errors found
you should go in and fix them yourself or you can use :code:`clang-format` to
do much of the formatting work for you.

Clang-format
+++++++++++++++++++
Clang-format is a code formatting tool that will refactor your code for you.
Clang-format is installed by the setup script in SJSU-Dev2. If the clang-format
command is not present on your machine, try pulling the latest master branch
and try running the setup script again.

To refactor your code with clang-format, all you have to do is run the
following: :code:`clang-format -i <path/to/file>`. The :code:`-i` flag means you
want to do an in place refactor. If you want to run this command, but you don't
want this to change your file, you can omit the :code:`-i` flag and it will dump
the refactored text to stdout. You can use io redirects to dump to a file and
review if the changes are to your liking.

Running presubmit checks
-------------------------
To run the whole set of presubmit checks, change into your project directory and
run :code:`make presubmit`. If you see this:

.. code-block:: console

    ============================
    | Everything looks good here |
    |                            |
    |           (⌐▪_▪)           |
    |                            |
    |      You may commit        |
    ============================

Then you passed.

If you see this:

.. code-block:: console

    ============================
    |        None of this!       |
    |                            |
    |        (╯°□ °)╯︵ ┻━┻      |
    |                            |
    |      Don't commit this     |
    ============================
    |                            |
    | Code style must conform ✔  |
    |   Commit must be clean ✔   |
    |     Tests must pass ✘      |
    |     Code must build ✔      |
    |                            |
    ============================

Then it failed and each **X** represents an area that you need to fix.
